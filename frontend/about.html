        <p class="section-subtitle">
          I am a third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science & Engineering at
          Parul University with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My
          academics have set a perfect platform for a strong foundation in core
          computer science concepts.
        </p>

          I primarily believe in learning by focusing on the fundamentals.
          Instead of rushing through technologies, I try to understand how
          things work from the inside, be it code flow, data handling, or system
          behavior. This helps me debug effectively and reason about edge cases
          to come up with reliable solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="section-subtitle" style="margin-top: 20px">
          With time, I have come to believe that more than rote tools or
          frameworks, strong logical skills and consistent practice make a
          difference. That forms the basis of my interest in Data Structures &
          Algorithms, or backend development for that matter, where I enjoy
          building systems from scratch and learning from the inside out.
